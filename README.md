## PROJECT PURPOSE AND GOAL

Donmovies is my first official nextJS application. When I decided to learn nextJS, I decided to follow a different approach, and not read the documentation, but actually learn it by building. I fell into lot and lot of squish tiny and big bugs( honestly I can almost draw them for you. I am sure they know my name by now. They will be like **yo guys Dammy has fallen into our trap again :)**), but all this just made me more determined and I am happy to say I built something I am really proud of.

## LESSON LEARNT

Through this project, I learnt a great deal about nextJS, how to integrate it with **firebase**, **getStaticProps**, **getStaticPaths** etc. 

I was able to learn more about how to use the contextAPI and the react hooks, and also broaden my knowledge on firebase. Although firebase has zero use in this project, all it does is let you **create an account**, **signin**, **reset password** and send **confirmation email links**.
